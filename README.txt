SDL-Keycode-Scancode-Tool v1.0.0 | zerico2005 | 2023/10/15

You can run the tool by opening index.html in your web broswer.

The keyboard data contains all 242 SDL_Scancodes and their SDL_Keycodes. The keyboard data is stored as Parallel Arrays in JavaScript, but can be found in as a C Struct in "original-keyboard-data.txt". There is a chance that there may be errors/typos in the SDL_Keycodes/SDL_Scancodes. If you find one, please report it to the github repository so it can be fixed.

The source code is available under a MIT license.
